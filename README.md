# Version Conversion

Find and download Minecraft mods for the version and mod loader you actually play on.  
No more searching through multiple Modrinth pages just to find nothing, just drop your mods and download!

## What it does
- Lets you search for mods and grab the right build using the [Modrinth API](https://docs.modrinth.com/api).  
- Converts between Minecraft versions and mod loaders *by finding the best release for you*!
- Saves you time when moving between mod loaders or game versions.

## Examples
- You have a Forge 1.19 mod, but you need it for Fabric 1.21 → Version Conversion finds the Fabric 1.21 build for you.  
- Updating from Fabric 1.21.4 → 1.21.5? Just select the new version and download.  

## What it doesn’t do
- It does **not** rewrite or patch mod files.
- If a mod doesn’t exist for your chosen version/loader, the tool can’t invent it.  

## Usage
1. Open the [Version Conversion webpage](https://melissasievertsson.github.io/VersionConversion).  
2. Drop in your mods you wish to convert. (you can drop mods with no valid versions too, meaning you can drop your entire mods folder!)
3. Pick your target Minecraft version and mod loader.  
4. Download and drop it into your mods folder.

## Limitations
- Availability depends on what the mod author uploaded to Modrinth.  
- Does **not** work with Modpacks, Shaders, or Resource Packs (yet).
